For now, this is where I will write down a basic overview of *how* the engine
works.

    For now, I have my own format for storing models and materials. In this
engine, a Model is a collection of Meshes and Materials. The collections are
ordered, and elements in them correspond to one another. For example, the first
mesh in the collection will use the first material in the collection, and so on.
A mesh is a collection of vertices, and a material is a collection of textures.
The formats .ForceModel and .ForceMaterial are pretty simple. You can
probably understand them just by reading them.
